        <h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
        <!--
            This is the coding block for your content in a paragraph
            The paragrah tag belongs to the "block" group of tags
            A "block" group tag places your content on a new line
            
            you can place all your paragragh txt content on one physical
            line, however, that would require a lot of scrolling right and left.
            you can have word wrap active in your editor and it will NOT affect 
            how the nrowser displayes your pragaraphh content. You can place
            your content on seperate lines yoursrself and it will NOT affect how 
            the browser displates your pragragh content.
        -->
        <p>The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tags begins a new line 
            the content is displayed by your browser. The browser does not display 
            your content in the physical syle of how you have entered your code in
            your html file.
        </p>
        <p> This is a second paragragh on the browser page. It will start a new line,
            Did the Go Live update the browser display of my saved charhes to the file?</p>
        <!---
            If you wish to use a component of a reserved tag(or the whole tag) you would be in trouble using the tag instead you can use special character strings to represent components of the tag such as < (&lt) and the > (&gt) symbol.
